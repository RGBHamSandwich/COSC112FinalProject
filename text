I think that we should have an instructions page ~

Intro:
    Welcome to Amherst Tower Defense! In our game, you'll be using towers—each representing a distinct chess
    piece—that unleash a barrage of bullets to defend against incoming waves of colorful balloons. First,
    you'll choose a map!

Towers:
    Once you've chosen your map, it's time to think about your strategy!
    On the right side of the screen, you'll see a shop. There, you can use your coins to buy towers to pop
        oncoming balloons.
    If you have enough coins, simply left-click on a tower to pick it up! Then you can place it on the map as
        you please. [insert optional notion about the map grid]
    If you change your mind about the tower, you can click on the empty bubble to put it back in the shop.




We can add also specific details to compensate for features we don't add, such as:
- the map grid: "While you can technically place your towers anywhere, keep a couple of things in mind:
                Placing a tower on a path doesn't block balloons; they'll just float past you!
                Every tower has it's own firing pattern—think about how a chess piece attacks!
                You can only place one of each tower!
