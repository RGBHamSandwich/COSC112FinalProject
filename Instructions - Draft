I think that we should have an instructions page ~

Intro:
    Welcome to Amherst Tower Defense!

    In our game, you'll be using towers—each representing a distinct chess piece—that unleash a barrage of
    bullets to defend against incoming waves of colorful balloons.

    First, you'll choose a map!

Towers:
    Once you've chosen your map, it's time to think about your strategy!

    On the right side of the screen, you'll see a shop. There, you can use your coins to buy towers to pop
    oncoming balloons.

    If you have enough coins, simply left-click on a tower to pick it up! Then you can place it on the map as
    you please. [insert optional notion about the map grid]

    If you change your mind about the tower, you can click on the empty bubble to put it back in the shop.

    Each tower has a unique firing pattern:
    Pawns fire one stream of bullets directly up.
    Bishops fire to the ____ and ____.
    Rooks fire up, down, left, and right.
    [insert queen firing pattern if needed]



We can add also specific details to compensate for features we don't add, such as:
- the map grid: "While you can technically place your towers anywhere, keep a couple of things in mind:
                Placing a tower on a path doesn't block balloons; they'll just float past you!
                Every tower has it's own firing pattern—think about how a chess piece attacks!
                You can only place one of each tower!
- map has to finish loading: "If you pop all of the balloons, there may be a brief waiting period before
               you can start the next level."
