I think that we should have an instructions page ~

Intro:
    ** Welcome to Amherst Tower Defense!

    **In our game, you'll be using towers—each representing a distinct chess piece—that unleash a barrage of
    **bullets to defend against incoming waves of colorful balloons.

    **First, you'll choose a map!

Towers:
    **Once you've chosen your map, it's time to think about your strategy!

    **On the right side of the screen, you'll see a shop. There, you can use your coins to buy towers to pop
    **oncoming balloons. As you pop balloons, you'll get more coins!

    **If you have enough coins, simply left-click on a tower to pick it up! Then you can place it on the map as
    **you please. Check out the tower and balloon designs to the right!

    [insert optional notion about the map grid]

    **If you change your mind about the tower, you can click on the empty bubble in the shop to put it back.

    **Each tower has a unique firing pattern:
    **Pawns fire one stream of bullets directly up.
    **Bishops fire to the upper right and lower left.
    **Rooks fire up, down, left, and right.
    **Queens fire in all eight possible directions.

We can add also specific details to compensate for features we don't add, such as:
*** the map grid: "While you can technically place your towers anywhere, keep a couple of things in mind:
                Placing a tower on a path doesn't block balloons; they'll just float past you!
                Every tower has it's own firing pattern—think about how a chess piece attacks!

- map has to finish loading: "If you pop all of the balloons, there may be a brief waiting period before
               you can start the next level."
