Welcome to README.txt.txt

This is the final project of Hena E, Kiara F, and Beck M!
We're proud to present Amherst Tower Defense, a creative game based off of the popular
    "tower defense" game format, most notably including Bloons Tower Defense.

There are no special libraries required to run our code; everything you need is contained within
    the code itself!

All navigation through the game is click-based; you won't need your keyboard at all!

The game will open on a "Start" screen, and there is an "Instructions" screen accessible from
    there. Otherwise, the game is largely exactly as you'd expect it to be.


To cover our bases, there is a text copy of the instructions below:

Welcome to Amherst Tower Defense!

    In our game, you'll be using towers—each representing a distinct chess piece—that unleash a barrage of
        bullets to defend against incoming waves of colorful balloons.

    First, you'll choose a map!

    Once you've chosen your map, it's time to think about your strategy!

    On the right side of the screen, you'll see a shop. There, you can use your coins to buy towers to pop
        oncoming balloons. As you pop balloons, you'll get more coins!

    If you have enough coins, simply left-click on a tower to pick it up! Then you can place it on the map as
        you please. Check out the tower and balloon designs to the right!

    While you can technically place your towers anywhere, keep a couple of things in mind:
        Placing a tower on a path doesn't block balloons; they'll just float past you!
        Every tower has it's own firing pattern—think about how a chess piece attacks!

    If you change your mind about the tower, you can click on the empty bubble in the shop to put it back.

    Each tower has a unique firing pattern:
        Pawns fire one stream of bullets directly up.
        Bishops fire to the upper right and lower left.
        Rooks fire up, down, left, and right.
        Queens fire in all eight possible directions.
